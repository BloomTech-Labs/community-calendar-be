## Project Overview

[Product Vision](https://www.notion.so/Community-Calendar-Labs-19-25c4624fa8fe46e49361d73215459050) on Notion.

[Planned Releases](https://www.notion.so/06de41bdd6124a459140e0b943b648a1) on Notion.

The Community Calendar Backend repository contains code for the three services in our stack.

<!-- Integrate future image of back architecture, including authentication token flow -->

1. An Apollo GraphQL service in the root directory that conducts business logic on GraphQL queries with data collected from the database and authentication services.

2. A Prisma Database ORM service defined in the `/prisma-client/` directory. The `prisma-client` is ready for deployment on any Prisma implementation, including free deployment on Heroku through [Prisma Cloud](https://www.prisma.io/cloud).

3. An Auth0 authentication application hosted on [Auth0](https://www.auth0.com) with custom rules and forms defined in the `/notes/` directory.

### Key Features

- Serve a list of community events (RC 1)
- Allow users to create accounts with Google, Facebook, or an email address (RC 1)
- Geocode event addresses into lattitude and longitude for location based searching (RC 2)
- Allow community members to create and update their own events (RC 2)
- Allow community members to RSVP to events (RC 2)
- Integrate user profiles for creating, saving, and managing events (RC 3)
- Integrate external event APIs from Ticketmaster, Facebook, and EventBrite (RC 4+)

### Backend Framework

We chose an Apollo GraphQL server over a RESTful API for the two reasons:

1. Allow web and mobile clients to request the exact event details they have space to render. This prevents overfetching and increases performance on mobile.

2. Allow the Community Calendar API to be seamless expanded to include integration of event data from external APIs in future releases

### Client repositories

This back end API is consumed by three clients:

1. Web application at [React Front End Repository](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/community-calendar-fe).
2. iOS application at [iOS Application Repository](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/community-calendar-ios).
3. Android application at [Android Application Repository](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/community-calendar-android).

## Build and Installation

Our server relies on Auth0 and another Prisma/PostgreSQL deployment to function correctly. If you would like to get your own local Community Calendar server running, clone this repo and follow [this guide here](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/community-calendar-be/blob/master/notes/prisma_auth0.md).

Once **Auth0** and **Prisma** is configured:

- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the local server
- vist your endpoint URL to interact with your server through the GraphQL Playground

### Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

Create a .env file that includes the following:

- PORT - (optional) Port for running the server locally, defaults to 4000
- AUTH0_DOMAIN - Auth0 domain for your Auth0 application.
- API_AUDIENCE - Auth0 API Audience
- NODE_ENV - Not required for local environment. Set to "production" when deploying.
- PRISMA - This is the endpoint for the Prisma deployment.
- SECRET - Secret used for Prisma service.
- TICKET_MASTER - Ticket Master API key.
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME - cloudinary cloud name
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY - cloudinary API key
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET - cloudinary API secret

## Endpoints

The GraphQL API consists of a single endpoint. In addition to the built-in documentation available from the GraphQL playground, the following queries and mutations can be consumed to conduct CRUD operations on the Community Calendar database:

### Queries

| Query Name      | Access Control      | Description                           |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `users (...)`   | authenticated users | Returns a list of users.              |
| `user (...)`   | authenticated users | Get user's information and events      |
| `checkId (...)` | auth0 service       | Verify whether a user already exists. |
| `events (...)`  | all users           | Returns a list of community events.   |
| `tags (...)`    | all users           | Returns a list of tags in the database|

### Mutations

| Mutation Name       | Access Control      | Description                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `addUser (...)`     | auth0 service       | Creates a newly registered user.            |
| `addEvent (...)`    | authenticated users | Create a community event.                   |
| `updateEvent (...)` | event creator       | Update community event details.             |
| `deleteEvent (...)` | event creator       | Remove a community event from the database. |
| `eventRsvp (...)`   | authenticated users | Connect a user to event RSVPs               |
| `eventSave (...)`   | authenticated users | A user can save an event to their profile   |

## Available Scripts

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in production mode. Will only work in deployed environments, since `dotenv` is disabled in production mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the GraphQL playground in the browser.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode. Defauts to port 4000 unless otherwised specified in the environmental variables.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. First resets, regenerates, and redeploys a testing prisma service out of the `prisma-client/testing` directory. <br /><br />
Requires a testing instance of Prisma including a postgres database to be running and configured in `~/prisma-client/testing/prisma.yml`.<br /><br />
Default configuration of the testing `prisma.yml` will work if you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and are running a postgres database image along with a local prisma service at `http://localhost:4466`.<br /><br />
See the [testing section](#testing) for more information.

## Testing

Our test runner is [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit and integration tests. 

For integration testing, we simulate queries and mutations on the server through the `apollo-serving-testing` library's `createTestClient()` function. There are queries and mutations to simulate the expected client server calls written in `graphql-tag` in the `__tests__/__testMutation.js` and `__tests__/__testQuery.js` files.

### Setting up a testing Prisma service and database

The test runner is configured by default to run the test suite against a prisma service hosted locally at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with an accompanying and postgres database mounted by [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Alternatively, you can configure the test runner to use a Prisma service deployed on the [Prisma Cloud](https://app.prisma.io/).

#### Running the tests with Docker Desktop

If you have Docker Desktop installed, you can set up your service and database by running `docker-compose up` from the root directory of the repository. Use `docker-compose up -d` to run your instances in the background. You can find more information on the docker command line interface in their [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).

If you've run docker instances with the Prisma CLI before, you may run into the error: 
```ERROR: for prisma  Cannot start service prisma: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint postgres_prisma_1 (b9aa3375c9374b77bab447b3777d1e5a7d78e0081106699b637065e6db4a5a88): Bind for 0.0.0.0:4466 failed: port is already allocated```. 

You can clear your Docker setup using the following commands:
`docker kill $(docker ps -aq)`
`docker rm $(docker ps -aq)`

After that, `docker-compose up` should put your back in business.

Further Prisma documentation for configuring local Prisma servers with Docker is available [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/tutorials/setup-prisma/create-new-db/postgres-eiyov7erah).


#### Running the tests with Prisma Cloud

If don't have to or can't run Docker Desktop, you can modify the `endpoint` and `secret` values in `prisma-client/testing/prisma.yml` to match your deployed [Prisma Cloud](https://app.prisma.io/) service.


### Testing architecture

Our test architecture is set up so that each time you run `npm run test` it resets, regenerates and redeploys your prisma service defined in `prisma-client/testing/prisma.yml` so you start from an empty database/ORM.

To create a Apollo Server instance that you can test, call the `constructTestServer()` function defined in `__tests/__testUtils.js`. When writing tests for resolvers that require authentication, you must pass in a valid `testUserId` out of your database as a parameter for `constructTestServer()`.

Since that database starts from empty for every test run, `__tests/__testUtils.js` also contains a `prismaConnection()` function that directly connects to your testing prisma service so you can create and delete test users during your setup and teardown.

Prisma does not provide a simple method for clearing all nodes from the service or data from the connected database, so every test must be written to "clean up" and created events or users when it is done running.
